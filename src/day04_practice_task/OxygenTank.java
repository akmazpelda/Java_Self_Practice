/* Create a class named OxygenTank. You are diving in the ocean. Your oxygen tank has a certain
level (number), and you must print a message based on the level:

		Above 90 - Your tank is full
		Above 80 - Still okay
		Above 70 - Don't go too far
		Above 60 - Start to head back
		Above 50 - Be careful, you're at 50%

			Example:
				   oxygenLevel = 75;

			Output:
				  Don't go too far
